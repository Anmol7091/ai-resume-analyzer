        "general": "The resume lacks professional polish and contains several issues that would make it difficult for an ATS to properly parse. The current internship experience (May 2024-present) appears to be in the future, which raises credibility concerns. The resume also uses passive language ('learned to work' rather than demonstrating actual accomplishments).",
        "header": "Contact information is clear, but social media links should include full URLs for better ATS parsing. The header appears twice in the document which is confusing.",
        "experience": "The internship description is vague and uses passive language. Bullet points lack specific metrics or achievements beyond the 70% improvement claim. Since the internship dates show May 2024-present (which is in the future), this raises red flags about accuracy.",
        "projects": "Project descriptions provide some technical details but lack context about your specific role, challenges overcome, or quantifiable results. They read more like feature lists than demonstrations of your capabilities.",
        "skills": "Technical skills section is basic and lacks organization or proficiency levels. Some technologies mentioned in projects (Zustand, clerk.js) aren't included in the skills section, creating inconsistency.",
        "education": "Education section is minimal with no mention of relevant coursework, GPA, or academic achievements beyond the single research paper mentioned.",
        "achievements": "Only one achievement is listed, with no details about the publication venue, impact, or your specific contribution to the research paper."

        "Add metrics and quantifiable results to all experience and project descriptions",
        "Expand your skills section with organization by category and proficiency levels",
        "Include relevant coursework and academic achievements in your education section",
        "Provide more details about your research paper publication (journal/conference name, your contribution)",
        "Ensure consistent formatting throughout the document",
        "Remove duplicate header information",
